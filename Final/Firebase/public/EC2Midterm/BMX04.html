<p>THE ORIGIN OF COLUMBUS BMX DATES BACK TO THE EARLY-80’S WHEN THE SPORT OF BMX RACING WAS FIRST EXPLODING IN POPULARITY ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY.</p>
<p>Although there wasn’t a local track in Columbus at the time, from 1980 to 1984, Columbus Schwinn assembled a nationally-recognized BMX racing team with local and regional riders.  In 1985, with interest in BMX continuing to grow in Columbus, an effort was made to build a track near Columbus Municipal Airport. Unfortunately, the plans stalled and the track was never built.</p>
<p>After fifteen years of no activity, in 2000, a small group of BMX enthusiasts (some of whom were around to witness the failed attempt in 1985) founded the nonprofit organization Columbus BMX, Inc. and devised a new plan to gain support and finally realize the dream of a BMX facility in Columbus.</p>
<p>After two years of planning and fundraising, including a $10,000 grant from the Heritage Fund and donations from local businesses and individuals, Columbus BMX broke ground in 2002 on land adjacent to Kenneth O. Dunn Stadium near the Bartholomew County Fairgrounds. CBMX was sanctioned by the NBL (National Bicycle League) and the first two races were held in September of 2002.</p>
<p>In 2003, Columbus BMX conducted its first full season of racing and hosted its first Indiana State Qualifier Series Race. The largest race of the season had 250 riders and over 700 spectators.</p>
<p>With tremendous support from the Bartholomew County Parks Department, area businesses, countless dedicated volunteers and, of course, the BMX racing community, Columbus BMX will conduct its 14th full season of racing in 2016. The current volunteer staff is dedicated to upholding the legacy of the track’s founders and continually strives to provide a first-class racing facility and the most exciting and family-friendly BMX atmosphere available anywhere. Come join us and Let’s Go Racing!</p>
