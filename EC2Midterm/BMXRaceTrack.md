## Langley BMX Track

From the moment that the starting gate slams down you and up to seven other racers blast at a full sprint toward the first obstacle, BMX racing will give you that rush of adrenaline you've been looking for.  Big jumps can mean big air.  Steep backsides, deep turns, and downhill sections can add up to massive speeds.
To realize the total thrill that BMX gives a rider, you really need to experience it.  With over 370 BMX tracks located all around the country, there is surely a USA BMX facility near you.  Once you try BMX racing, we practically guarantee you'll be hooked for life.
